**This repository is for sharing my recommendations on restaurants, bars, and cafes for those who are going to visit Kyoto, Japan for ROSCon 2022**

## WHAT is this list?

This is the list of my personal recommendations on where to eat, drink and enjoy your time outside of the conference in Kyoto based on my actual experience.
One caveat here is that I haven't been able to visit Kyoto since the pandemic so the quality and the menus might have changed since I visited there last time.

## WHO am I?

I'm working for a computer vision software company focusing on 3D SLAM technologies.  
We are in the robotics space, especially in the autonomous mobile robots. But this repo is my personal one, theview is my onw, nothing to do with the company I'm working for.   
But more importantly in this context, I'm born and raised in Japan and went to Kyoto University for my undergrad and grad school. Then my parents live there still so even after my graduation, I visited Kyoto several times every year before the pandemic.


## WHY am I doing this?

1. I felt very much honored and proud when I heard that Kyoto hosts ROSCon this year as Kyoto is the place where I call my home town.  
Kudan sponsors this event and my colleagues are going to be there to showcase my company's technologies.   
Unfortunately, I cannot make a visit but I was wondering if there's anything I can do to help ROSCon2022 participants enjoy their time in Kyoto more beyond the conference itself.   

2. I know it's hard to find great restaurants, bars etc in an unfamiliar place, especially when the information in English is much limited and skewed toward touristic places.  
I have been passionate about trying out various dining venues and I was actually obsessed with it when I was in Kyoto. I still have so many good memories with so many good places.

That's how I arrived at this idea: sharing the list of places you can enjoy the taste and the atmosphere of Kyoto.  
I'm using GitHub platform to pay tribute to all the roboticists on this platform (I'm on the business side and not really "commit" things in my daily work).
