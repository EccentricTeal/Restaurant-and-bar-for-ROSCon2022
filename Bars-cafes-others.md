### Bars in Kyoto

** Here is the list of my recommended bars. 

There are several things to note.
- These bars are mostly 30-40 mins by train from RsoCon venue and <10 minutes walk from many restaurants in the other list.
- Price range indicated here is for bars and it's different from the restaurant list.
- Many bars have many Japanese whisky selections but authentics bars don't usually have wide Japanese sake selection.  If you are looking for Japanese Sake, please go to any Izakaya-style restaurant.  Many restaurants in my restaurant list have a good selection of Japanese Sake) 
- Smoking is allowed in most bars in Japan. So if you don’t like the smell of cigarettes/ e-cigarettes, I wouldn’t recommend going there, to be honest.
- Many bars have way more cocktail menus than what they put on their menu list. You cannot tell the price unless you ask specifically.You can ask the price but people just trust the bar’s calculation in general.


## K6
- URL: http://www.ksix.jp/
- 3 highlights:The most iconic bar in Kyoto, very professional bartender, great fresh fruit cocktails 
- Price range: $$ (one cocktail ~6USD, one fresh fruit cocktail ~8-10USD)
- Book in advance: Better to do so
- Non-Japanese-friendliness: You can communicate basic needs for sure.  
- Address: Japan, 〒604-0922 Kyoto, Nakagyo Ward, Higashiikesucho, 481 ヴァルズビル 2F
- Comment: It’s better to tell your request and ask them to make one for you rather than just order typical cocktails such as Jin tonic, Rum Coke etc.  Many popular authentic bars in Kyoto with the letter of “K” are run by ex-K6 bartenders. 

## K-ya Honlkan (K家 本館)

- Book in advance: Better to do so
- Non-Japanese-friendliness: You can communicate basic needs for sure.  
- Address:　105 Yaoyacho, Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto, 604-8072, Japan
- Comment: One of the bars I would usually take my non-Japanese friends when they visit Kyoto with me. Very traditional appearance but really authentic bar. There is another branch nearby (K-ya Bekkan/ K家 別館)

## Bar Rocking chair

- Address: 434-2 Tachibanacho, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto, 600-8044, Japan
- Comment: It’s slightly outside of the main restaurant & bar area in Kyoto but that makes this place more speak-easy than others. Great cocktails 

## Bar Stand
- URL: https://tabelog.com/kyoto/A2601/A260301/26014954/
- 3 highlights: very hidden in a very narrow street, reserved but friendly bartender, (IIRC) good selection of single molt whiskey
- Price range: $$$
- Book in advance: Better to do so
- Non-Japanese-friendliness: Sorry, I’m not sure… but I’m pretty positive that the bartender will do his best
- Address: 199-2 Shimokorikicho, Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto, 604-8016, Japan
- Comment: It’s on the second floor (or first floor in UK) so you need to go up a stair on a narrow street from main Kiyamachi-street

## Finlandia
- URL: http://finlandiabar.com/
- 3 highlights: In a traditional Japanese house in Gion area, Countless variations of Absolut Vodka, Great fresh fruit cocktails
- Price range: $$$
- Book in advance: Better to do so
- Non-Japanese-friendliness: I saw several non-Japanese tourists in the bar when I visited so it should be English-friendly.
- Address: Japan, 〒605-0074 Kyoto, Higashiyama Ward, Gionmachi Minamigawa, 570-123 祇園又吉
- Comment: They have a private room for a group of max 8? (sorry not 100% sure) on the upstairs, which is also nice for celebrations. This is also the one I take non-japanese friends while in Kyoto

## Calvador (カルバドール)
- URL: https://calvador.jp/
- 3 highlights: earns the highest review in the Japanese version of “Yelp”, many calvados, Really authentic appearance
- Price range: $$$
- Book in advance: Better to do so
- Non-Japanese-friendliness: I’m not sure...
- Address:　Japan, 〒604-0932 Kyoto, Nakagyo Ward, 二条下る妙満寺前町446
- Comment: At least when I was in Kyoto, it was at the highest rank in the bar category in Kyoto on Tabelog, the most popular review site in Japan. Personally I like their Jin Back a lot. 

## Moonwalk
- URL: https://barmoonwalk.jp/store_info/sanjo-kiyamachi/
- 3 highlights: Almost all drinks are 1.5 USDs, bar for drinking hard, lots of local university students
- Price range: $ (or even half dollar mark)
- Book in advance: Not needed usually
- Non-Japanese-friendliness: The bartenders are young so should be able to manage somehow using technologies
- Address:　Japan, 〒604-8002 Kyoto, Nakagyo Ward, Ishiyacho, 115 辻田ビル 2階
- Comment: Don’t go there if you are looking for authentic bars but this is also the other extreme of bars you cannot fine easily outside of Kyoto. Even one shot is 1.5 USD so you can imagine how tempting it is to give someone multiple shots.

## Cassis Bar (カシスバー)
- URL: https://tabelog.com/kyoto/A2601/A260301/26005220/
- 3 highlights: My “third-place”, typical individual-owned bar in Kyoto, Cassis-based cocktail is not its specialty
- Price range: $$
- Book in advance: You need to call the bar before you visit to make sure it’s open on that day. (The owner really take a day-off randomly)
- Non-Japanese-friendliness: The bartender understands basic English
- Address: Japan, 〒604-8017 Kyoto, Nakagyo Ward, Zaimokucho, 188-3 光ビル
- Comment: The bar I went to the most often while I was in Kyoto/ Japan. It’s in a pretty standard commercial building, the interior is not so special to be honest so it could be really just a local bar but I love it.

## Shot Bar Beast (ショットバー ビースト)
- URL: http://cozygroup.co.jp/shotbarbeast/
- 3 highlights: Lighting in red, my another third-place, 
- Price range: $$
- Book in advance: Not needed in general
- Non-Japanese-friendliness: The bartenders are young so should be able to manage somehow using technologies
- Address: Japan, 〒604-8015 Kyoto, Nakagyo Ward, Nabeyacho, 214, 4F
- Comment: Another bar I frequently visited while I was in Kyoto/ Japan. Again it’s just a local bar in kyoto. But I have so many good memory (with hang-over)

## HUB Sanjo-Kiyamachi (ハブ　三条木屋町店)
