- **Comment**: I visited this for almost all occasions. It's maybe tricky to find this restaurant for visitors from outside of Kyoto (even for Japanese) but definitely worth a try. It's located on a dodgy narrow street but once you enter the restraunt, there are many vegetables, friendly and energetic staff.  They feature fresh local and seasonal vegetables. I'm not so interested in vegetables and one of guys who always want to have meat in a dinner but the vegetables here look quite mouth-watering. Actually also there are many menus with meat.
